# High-Level Design (HLD) Document

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level design of the system, detailing its architecture, components, and interactions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's design for stakeholders and development teams.

## Objectives
- Define system architecture
- Outline key components and their responsibilities
- Describe data flow and interactions between components
- Establish guidelines for future development and scalability

## System Architecture
The system follows a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. It consists of the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - User Interface (UI): Web and mobile applications for end-users.
   - APIs: RESTful services for communication with the backend.

2. **Application Layer**
   - Microservices: Each service is responsible for a specific business function.
   - API Gateway: Manages request routing, load balancing, and authentication.

3. **Data Layer**
   - Database: A combination of SQL and NoSQL databases to store structured and unstructured data.
   - Cache: In-memory data store for quick data retrieval.

## Key Components
1. **User Management Service**
   - Responsibilities: User registration, authentication, authorization, profile management.
   - Technology: Node.js, JWT for token-based authentication.

2. **Product Service**
   - Responsibilities: Manage product listings, inventory, and related data.
   - Technology: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL for data storage.

3. **Order Management Service**
   - Responsibilities: Handle order creation, update, and tracking.
   - Technology: Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB for scalable data management.

4. **Payment Service**
   - Responsibilities: Process payments, handle payment gateways.
   - Technology: Go, gRPC for communication with external payment providers.

5. **Notification Service**
   - Responsibilities: Send email/SMS notifications to users.
   - Technology: Node.js, AWS SNS for message delivery.

## Data Flow
1. User interacts with the UI by sending a request.
2. The request is routed through the API Gateway to the corresponding microservice.
3. Each microservice processes the request, interacts with the database or other services as needed, and sends a response back to the API Gateway.
4. The API Gateway aggregates the responses (if necessary) and sends the final response back to the user.

## Scalability Considerations
- Each microservice can be scaled independently based on demand.
- Implementation of load balancing to distribute incoming traffic evenly.
- Use of containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) to manage microservices and deployment.

## Security
- All communication between components to be encrypted (HTTPS).
- Implementation of OAuth2 for secure API access.
- Regular security audits and compliance checks.

## Conclusion
This high-level design provides a structured approach to build a scalable and maintainable system. Future developments can build upon this foundation, adapting and evolving the architecture as needs change.
